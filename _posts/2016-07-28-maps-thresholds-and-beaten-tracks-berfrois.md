  On the corner of the rue de la Tombe Issoire in southern Paris, the
  photographer finds a map lying on the pavement, torn into three pieces. The
  map shows the streets of the thirteenth and fourteenth arrondissements which
  lie in its vicinity. Written by hand on the fragments is a series of numbers
  which suggest significant locations.
